        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am an international student in Toronto, Canada, pursuing a diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis at George Brown College.
            My passion lies in solving real-world problems through code, and I specialize in Java, Python, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have hands-on experience through my academic projects and a Java development internship, where I honed my skills in building web applications and debugging complex systems.
            I aspire to contribute as a software developer and continuously grow by learning cutting-edge technologies.
